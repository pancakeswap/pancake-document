PancakeSwap Prediction is a fun and simple decentralized prediction market.

> ### Predict whether BNB's price will rise or fall – guess correctly to win! <a id="predict-whether-bnbs-price-will-rise-or-fall-guess-correctly-to-win"></a>

It's easy to take part:

* Predict if the price of BNBUSDT will be higher or lower than it was when the “LIVE” phase starts.
* If you enter an “UP” position, and the BNBUSDT “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 5 minute LIVE phase, you WIN! And if it’s lower, you lose.
* If you enter a “DOWN” position, and the BNBUSDT “Closed Price” is higher than the “Locked Price” at the end of the 5 minute LIVE phase, you LOSE! If it’s lower, you win.

Have fun!
