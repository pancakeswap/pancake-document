# Create a Wallet

![](../.gitbook/assets/how-to-make-a-crypto-wallet-header.png)

To get started on your PancakeSwap journey on Aptos, the first thing you'll need is to set up a wallet that supports Aptos Chain. Wallets are available both on desktop computers and on smartphone devices. You'll need to choose the wallet that fits your needs best.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**When you're setting up a wallet, be sure to:**

* ✅ **Download and install only the latest version from an official source.**
* ✅ **Follow the setup guide carefully.**
* ✅ **Safely back up your recovery phrases.**
* ❌ **NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.**
* ❌ **NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app.**
{% endhint %}

## Smartphone/Mobile or Desktop wallet?

{% hint style="warning" %}
At the time of writing, there are a limited number of mobile wallets with Aptos support. Chefs will include more wallets in the tutorial when they are available.

**We recommend using** [**desktop wallets**](wallet-guide.md#desktop-web-browser-wallets) **until more mobile wallets are ready.**
{% endhint %}

Mobile device wallets and desktop-based wallets have different strengths and weaknesses. Consider which fits your needs better to help decide which type of wallet to use.
