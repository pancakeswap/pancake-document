# Degen Mode

The Degen Trading Mode offers traders an alternative way of trading as compared to conventional trading methods. Traders who prefer to reduce screen time analyzing the market and have a more hands-off approach can choose this trading mode. During periods of high volatility, traders can maximize their gains with 0 slippage, high leverage and extremely low fees. In low volatility, traders can speculate on minor price movements.

In the beginning, Degen Trading Mode will be available for BTCUSD and ETHUSD, supporting a max. leverage of 750x for both long and short market orders. Traders will need to input the principal (collateral amount) before opening a position with zero slippage.&#x20;

Degen mode is available on both BNB Chain and Arbitrum on Perpetuals V2
