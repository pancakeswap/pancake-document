# Syrup Pools

**Syrup Pools: where sweet, new tokens meet the PancakeSwap community!**

Syrup Pools allow Binance Smart Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to CAKE token holders.

Syrup Pool is split into two sections: Core and Community.

* Core will be initially selected by the PancakeSwap team.
* Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Syrup Pool, but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Since PancakeSwap has had the [fairest launch ever](https://medium.com/@pancakeswap/the-fairest-launch-ever-5b246644ba2a), Syrup Pool projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the largest \(and most active\) BSC community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the PancakeSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).
