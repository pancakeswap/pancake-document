### What’s the difference between the “Auto CAKE Pool” and the “Manual CAKE Pool”? <a id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your CAKE tokens to earn more CAKE tokens.**

But there are some differences:

**Manual CAKE**

* You need to harvest or compound \(reinvest\) your CAKE by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits [SYRUP Token](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-faq#whats-syrup-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto CAKE**

* Stake your CAKE and forget about it! The CAKE you stake in this Syrup Pool will be automatically compounded \(reinvested\) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit SYRUP to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto CAKE Syrup Pool? <a id="what-are-the-fees-for-the-auto-cake-syrup-pool"></a>

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee**

* **0.1%    if you unstake \(withdraw\) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more CAKE in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 CAKE, then 0.02 CAKE would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The CAKE collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee is **burned every week** as part of the regular CAKE token burns.

This is a good thing for CAKE holders because it reduces the overall amount of CAKE tokens in existence, which helps reduce inflation.

### What's the best way to use the Auto CAKE Syrup Pool? <a id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your CAKE, but only withdraw after 72 hours \(if you need to\). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto CAKE bounty? <a id="whats-the-auto-cake-bounty"></a>

**Auto CAKE Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto CAKE pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto CAKE Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of CAKE you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction![
