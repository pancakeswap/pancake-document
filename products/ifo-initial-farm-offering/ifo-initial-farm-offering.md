# IFO (Initial Farm Offering)

## Intro

Buy new tokens using CAKE-BNB LP tokens.&#x20;

The project gets the BNB, PancakeSwap burns the CAKE. **You get the tokens.**

1. **You will need CAKE-BNB LP tokens** to participate.
2. **CAKE tokens equating to half of the total funds raised will be burned forever**: If the full $1,000,000 USD allocation is raised, then **** $500,000 of CAKE tokens will be burned.

## **How to participate in an IFO**

Visit [https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo) to find out more about IFOs.

Before Sale:

1. [Buy CAKE](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/?\_gl=1\*1bc8owa\*\_ga\*ODA4ODE5MjM4LjE2MDUxNTI3NTE.\*\_ga\_334KNG3DMQ\*MTYwNTQ4OTEwNy4yNi4xLjE2MDU0ODkxMjcuMA..#/swap) and BNB tokens
2. [Get CAKE-BNB LP tokens](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/?\_gl=1\*14203p6\*\_ga\*ODA4ODE5MjM4LjE2MDUxNTI3NTE.\*\_ga\_334KNG3DMQ\*MTYwNTQ4OTEwNy4yNi4xLjE2MDU0ODkyMzAuMA..#/pool) by adding CAKE and BNB liquidity

During Sale:

1. While the sale is live, commit your CAKE-BNB LP tokens to buy the IFO tokens at [https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo](https://pancakeswap.finance/ifo)

After Sale:

1. When the sale is complete, claim the IFO tokens you've bought. Your unspent funds will also be sent back to you.
2. Done! In the case of an [overflow](https://app.gitbook.com/@pancakeswap-1/s/pancakeswap/\~/drafts/-MMK-KmBq5\_Mfs94Ul6x/core-products/ifo-initial-farm-offering#overflow) you can unstake your remaining CAKE-BNB LP tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you decide to acquire CAKE-BNB LP tokens before the IFO starts, you can stake them in the [CAKE-BNB Farm](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms) to earn CAKE token rewards while waiting for the sale.

{% hint style="warning" %}
While you are holding CAKE-BNB LP tokens you will be at risk of [Impermanent Loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained).
{% endhint %}

## **What is the “Overflow” sale method?** <a href="#overflow" id="overflow"></a>

TLDR: Basically, the more you put in, the more you will get, and you’ll get back anything that doesn’t get spent.

In the “Overflow” method, users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the IFO, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It's possible to receive no tokens at all: If you commit a very small amount of LP tokens compared to the total amount committed by others, your contribution may be such a small part of the total that you may not qualify for even a small portion of the tokens sold.\
In such a case, you will still be able to reclaim all the CAKE-BNB LP tokens you committed.
{% endhint %}

## What happens if the IFO doesn't raise all the funds targeted?

The sale will proceed as normal, and all funds contributed will be spent.

## Want to launch your own IFO?

Launch your project with PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain’s most-used AMM project and liquidity provider, to bring your token directly to the most active and rapidly growing community on BSC.
