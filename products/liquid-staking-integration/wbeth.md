# WBETH

**Wrapped Beacon Ethereum (WBETH)** is a liquid staking derivative token representing staked ETH and its rewards. It’s a wrapped version of BETH, where 1WBETH represents 1 BETH, and is created by Binance Earn that allows users to participate in ETH staking rewards from the Ethereum network. Wrapped tokens are a way to use cryptocurrencies on blockchains other than the blockchain they were originally built on while being backed by their underlying asset. \
\
WBETH also represents the staking rewards accrued by BETH token on ETH Staking after 2023-04-27 08:00 (UTC). For BETH holders, further support to convert BETH to WBETH at a 1:1 fixed rate will be available in the coming weeks.\
