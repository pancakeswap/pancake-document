Like iCAKE and vCAKE, bCAKE is a fixed-term CAKE staking benefit designed for our loyal CAKE holders. By locking CAKE in the fixed-term CAKE staking pool, users can boost earning from selected farms up to 2x.

The boost multiplier is calculated based on how much CAKE you lock, how long you are locking them for, and how much liquidity in the farm you are trying to boost.

If you haven't locked any CAKE in the CAKE staking pool, click "Go to Pool" and follow the instructions to initiate a fixed-term staking position.

To learn more about how to do fixed-term CAKE staking, read [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/syrup-pool/new-cake-pool#fixed-term-staking).

#### Locate the farm and the position you want to boost <a href="#cf04ee3e-9678-4fc4-bf79-dcc5620a83fd" id="cf04ee3e-9678-4fc4-bf79-dcc5620a83fd"></a>

You can only boost your earning from farms with bCAKE enabled. To look for those farms, check the tags section of each farm and look for the green rocket tag labelled “Boosted”.

Alternatively, use the “Booster Available” filter within the “Farm Types” selector to quickly filter all the bCAKE-enabled farms.

#### Stake your position

In order to activate bCAKE, your position must be staking in the farm.

To learn more about yield farming, check out [this](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) tutorial.

{% hint style="info" %}
In Farm and bCAKE V3, the process has been streamlined, so you are no longer required to enable bCAKE or migrate your stakings.
{% endhint %}

#### Activate bCAKE <a href="#b3a80f22-5043-4e4b-afae-93b4abec504e" id="b3a80f22-5043-4e4b-afae-93b4abec504e"></a>

Once ready, you should see the available boost multiplier for the farming position you are currently staking. To learn more about how the bCAKE multiplier is calculated, read [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/yield-farming/bcake/faq#why-do-my-multipliers-change-even-after-activation).

To activate the boost, click the "Boost" button, and confirm the transaction from your wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that any user actions to the farming position or CAKE staking pool will automatically update your boost multiplier based on the latest data and statistics from farms and the CAKE staking pool.

{% endhint %}

There is a limit to the number of farming positions that are able to boost simultaneously. To check the number of remaining boosters, refer to the panel on top.

You will need to unset an active booster in order to activate bCAKE on other positions.

#### Unset bCAKE <a href="#6fa438f5-eea6-4d66-9b56-24780cedd273" id="6fa438f5-eea6-4d66-9b56-24780cedd273"></a>
