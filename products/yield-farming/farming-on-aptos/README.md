<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/farming-on-aptos.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

With our multichain deployment, PancakeSwap is now bringing the iconic yield farming experience to liquidity providers on Aptos. Yield Farms allow users to earn CAKE while supporting PancakeSwap by staking LP Tokens.

Check out the [main section](../) to learn more about yield farming.

We designed the product experience to be consistent across different blockchains. Therefore, if you are a seasonal Farm user on BSC, you will feel right at home when farming on Aptos. If you are new to liquidity farming, check out our [How to Use Farms guide](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) to get started.

To learn more about how to bridge your assets and CAKE between BSC and Aptos. Check out the [CAKE Bridging Guide](../../../get-started-aptos/cake-bridging-guide.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Yield farming can give better rewards than Syrup Pools, but it comes with a risk of **Impermanent Loss**. It’s not as scary as it sounds, but it is worth learning about the concept before you get started.

Check out this great [article about Impermanent Loss ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)from Binance Academy to learn more.
