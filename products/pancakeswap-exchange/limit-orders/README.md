# 📋 Limit Orders

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/limit\_orders\_header.png)

Limit orders allow you to get your swaps at desired prices by leaving instructions to fill buy or sell orders at specific prices. The trade will only be executed if the price on PancakeSwap reaches your limit price (or better).
