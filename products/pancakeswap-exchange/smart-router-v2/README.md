PancakeSwap Smart Router is a routing algorithm that links the AMM and stableswap (BNB Chain), and the AMM and market makers (Ethereum), to provide better liquidity and pricing. It uses a smart order routing algorithm that executes trades across multiple pools to find the best price for traders. For more information on StableSwap [click here](broken-reference) and for the Market Maker integration [click here](../market-maker-integration.md).

The Kitchen will gradually roll out StableSwap pairs to further test and improve the product.

## Why should I use the Smart Router for my AMM swaps?&#x20;

* Swap your stablecoins or other pairs with similar asset prices more efficiently with the same trade steps.
* Swap against market makers, who may provide better execution on trades than the normal PancakeSwap AMM.
* With the StableSwap function, the trading slippage is lower than normal AMM.
* The StableSwap trading fees are lower compared to the normal AMM.

## Still Cooking&#x20;

* Better UI on output.
* Split routes for more efficient trades. Eg. Router sends 50% of the pair to a different route to save fees depending on the trade size and liquidity.&#x20;
