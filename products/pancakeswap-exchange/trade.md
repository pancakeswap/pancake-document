# Token Swaps

![](../../.gitbook/assets/swap-trade-header.png)

****[**Token swaps**](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap) on PancakeSwap are a simple way to trade one BEP-20 token for another via automated liquidity pools, and also with market makers when trading ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.

When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **0.25% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.17%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.0225%** - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.

**0.0575%** - Sent towards CAKE buyback and burn.

The fee is reduced if you are trading a pair available through our BNB Chain [stableswap](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/stableswap) or our [market maker integration](market-maker-integration.md) on Ethereum.
