# How to Add/Remove Liquidity

![](../../.gitbook/assets/how-to-add-remove-liquidity-header.png)

"Liquidity" is central to how PancakeSwap's Exchange works. You can add liquidity for any token pair by staking both through the Liquidity page.

In return for adding liquidity, you'll receive trading fees for that pair, and receive either an NFT or LP Tokens you can stake in [Farms](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms) to earn CAKE rewards!

## Exchange V3

To provide liquidity, you’ll need to commit an amount of any token pair you like. Your lowest value (in USD) of the two tokens will be the limit to the liquidity you can provide.

You can easily trade for any tokens you need. Visit our [How to Trade on PancakeSwap](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/trade-guide) guide if you need to.

In this example, we will add V3 liquidity using ETH and USDC.

1 - Visit the [Liquidity page](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/pool).
