## Extending your lock staking duration
Changed your mind during the lock staking duration? No problem. You can always extend the time of your locked CAKE by simply clicking "Extend" and choose how much time you want to add on top of the current lock . Remember, the longer you lock, the higher your yield will be boosted. The maximum locking duration is 52 weeks.

Please note that you can not shorten the locking period nor withdraw your CAKE prematurely. 

## Adding more CAKE to your lock
Want to add more CAKE into the fixed-term pool? Easy. You can do that by renewing your fixed-term staking position. Simply click "Add CAKE", and choose how much CAKE you want to deposit.

Please note that adding more CAKE to an existing lock resets your staking term based off the remaining lock duration, essentially “renewing” your fixed-term staking position. This results in lower APY because your compounding over a short period of time. 

## What happens at the end of the lock duration? What is "After Burning"?


When your fixed-term staking period ends and your CAKE unlocks, you have 7 days to complete one of two options:

Lock your CAKE to begin a new fixed-term staking period, or
Convert your staked CAKE to flexible staking

During this 7 day period, you will still earn CAKE at the same APY as your lock period.

After 7 days if you have not done one of the two options, your staked CAKE will enter what is called "After Burning". In "After Burning" you will still earn CAKE but a portion of your rewards will be sent to burn at a linearly decreasing APR over 90 days, where your APR will be 0% after 90 days.  

The “After Burning” state will last for 90 days until all the CAKE rewards are burnt. So, to avoid missing out on CAKE rewards, at the end of your lock staking period, we recommend starting a new fixed-term staking period or converting your CAKE to flexible staking.
