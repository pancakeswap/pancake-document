PancakeSwap is an Automated Market Maker \(AMM\), and the Exchange is at the heart of PancakeSwap. PancakeSwap is the leading AMM on the Binance Smart Chain, and as statistics tell, the most popular Decentralized Exchange \(DEX\) ever!

The PancakeSwap Exchange offers several features that support decentralized trading:

## Swapping/Trading <a id="swapping-trading"></a>

PancakeSwap lets users trade without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange. Everything you do on PancakeSwap is routed directly through your own walletâ€”no need to trust someone else with your coins!

## Liquidity Pools <a id="liquidity-pools"></a>

The PancakeSwap exchange can only operate when there's enough liquidity to support trades; if nobody wanted to sell you BNB for example, then it wouldn't matter how much you wanted to trade for some.

Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use.

## Yield Farming <a id="yield-farming"></a>

Yield farming lets users that are providing liquidity earn CAKE rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract. The incentive is to balance out the risk of [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) that comes along with locking in your liquidity.

## Initial Farm Offerings \(IFOs\) <a id="initial-farm-offerings-ifos"></a>

An Initial Farm Offering is an event that lets users buy into a limited-time offer to purchase new tokens. The IFO price is usually very generous.
