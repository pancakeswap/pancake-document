# 🧑⚖ Farm Auctions

### Introduction

#### What are Farm Auctions?

1. Farm Auctions are a highly effective way for project teams to boost token liquidity, increase trading volume, and draw in organic traffic/users
2. As long as a project bids with sufficient CAKE tokens, they can earn an incentivized Community Farm on PancakeSwap
3. The marketing coverage also benefits projects in terms of community awareness and reach&#x20;
4. The CAKE tokens submitted as bids by the winning project teams will be burned, accruing value to all other CAKE holders

### Mechanics

[This](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms/auction) is the main site of our Farm Auctions product; it is where:

1. Auctions are held, with the running leaderboard displayed during Auction periods
2. Past bidders and winners are archived
3. A running list of whitelisted project teams can be found

We typically hold Farm Auctions every three weeks. These are the steps for a project team to participate in a Farm Auction:

1. Projects have to apply [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQNsAfh98SAfcqJKR3is2hdvMRdnvfd2F3Hql96vXHgIi3Bw/viewform) to be whitelisted for Auction bidding
2. We will add whitelisted project teams to a Telegram Announcement group
3. There will be a pre-announced 1-hour window for project teams to bid using their whitelisted wallet address
4. Participating project teams must submit a bid that is equal to or higher than the minimum initial bid
5. At the end of the 1-hour window, the top 3 bidders will earn an incentivized Community Farm within 48 hours of the Farm Auction ending
6. All CAKE bids from the 3 winning projects will be burned. Winning projects’ tokens will be added to and stay on PancakeSwap’s “Extended” token list
7. For projects that did not win, your CAKE bids will be returned, and you can try again in the next Farm Auction
