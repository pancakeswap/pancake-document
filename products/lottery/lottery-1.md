# Lottery

**Specifics:**

* Lottery Ticket Fee for 1 ticket: 1 CAKE&#x20;
* Single User Lottery Entry Limit: No overall limit, but only 50 can be bought at one time through the UI
* Paying for one ticket will give users a random 4 digit combination with each digit being between 1-14, for e.g. “1-9-3-2”

****

**How to win:**

To win the lottery jackpot (50% of the entire lottery pool), users need to match all 4 numbers on their tickets in the same position as the 4 winning numbers.

If you don’t match all 4, no need to worry. As long as you match 2 or more numbers in the correct position, you are guaranteed to win a reward.\


**Winning Ratio:**

* Match all 4 numbers in the exact order = win 50% of the pot (or split the pot if more than 1 winner).&#x20;
* Match 3 numbers in the exact order = win or split 20% of the pot.
* Match 2 numbers in the exact order = win or split 10% of the pot.
* Burn the remaining 20% of the pot.

Please note - in the event that no participants were able to match 3 numbers on any draw, the 20% allocated to winners will then be burned accordingly.

For example, if the final 4 winning numbers are “1-9-3-2”:\


* “2-3-9-1” = match 0
* **“1-9-3-2” = match all 4**
* “1-9-2-2” = match 3
* “2-3-3-2” = match 2
* “1-2-1-2” = match 2

**How are ticket numbers drawn?**\
****

The lottery aims to be completely random. Even though the ticket numbers given out are determined by a front-end logic, there is an extremely low chance that anyone is able to determine the 4 winning numbers ahead of time.\


* The 1st lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the number of participating users at the entry deadline.
* The 2nd lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the total pooled cake balance at the entry deadline.
* The 3rd lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the timestamp of the last lottery participant at the entry deadline.
* The 4th lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the block difficulty at the entry deadline.
