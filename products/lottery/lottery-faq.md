## Are all ticket numbers unique?

There are a total of 38,416 different ticket combinations. This may be adjusted later based on the number of participants.&#x20;

Ticket numbers are given out randomly. As such, there is a small chance that a user receives the same 4 digits in two tickets held.

## What if someone buys all of the number combinations?

This is close to impossible as ticket numbers are given out randomly. One participant is able to acquire 2 tickets that have the same 4 digits, so they would have a very hard time acquiring all of the unique combinations.&#x20;

## What transaction fee will I pay for buying a ticket?

Each ticket purchase will require a unique transaction. For example, buying 2 tickets will require participants to pay for 2 transactions. The same will apply when claiming rewards.
