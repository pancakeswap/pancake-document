PancakeSwap's Lottery is not only a good way to make stacks of CAKE, it's also loads of fun! This guide will walk you through getting involved in the Lottery.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Lottery has changed a little since its first iteration. Lottery v2 lets you win more often, have some control over your tickets, and has more potential for huge CAKE jackpots to get your mouth watering.

## Deciding if you'd like to enter a round

‌Not all Lottery rounds are equal. When a lottery jackpot isn't won, the next round's prize pool will increase; the longer it's been since someone has won the jackpot, the larger the Lottery prize pool will be.

‌The longer a round is open, the more people can buy a ticket. Each ticket sold increases the prize pool further. Here's how to check the current round's prize pool and remaining time.

‌1. Visit the[ PancakeSwap Lottery page](https://pancakeswap.finance/lottery) and look at the top of the page. You'll see the current round's prize pool shown in (estimated) US dollar value.

This is the amount to be shared between all winners.

‌2. A little lower down the page you'll find the remaining time before the current round is drawn.

Remember, a lot can change in the remaining time. Many more tickets may be sold. Each sold ticket both increases the prize pool, and lowers the odds of an individual ticket winning.

‌If you're unsure, you can always wait until later into the round to decide with more information. Just don't wait too long and miss out!

## Buying Lottery tickets

‌Buying tickets is easy.&#x20;

You just need a little CAKE though: each ticket costs approximately $5 USD (the exact CAKE price is set at the start of the round).

You can choose to either randomize your lottery ticket numbers, or to choose your ticket numbers manually. Choose between the randomized numbers and manual numbers tabs below for a guide to each method.

3\. Before you continue, it's worth considering the bulk purchase discounts. The more tickets you buy, the greater the discount.

The discount starts at 2 tickets, and scales all the way to 100 tickets where you will save almost 5% on your purchase (4.95%).

4\. When you're happy with the number of tickets you want to buy, click **Confirm** and confirm your action in your wallet.
