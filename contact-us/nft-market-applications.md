In phase 2 of the NFT Market, collection owners will be able to list their collections so that NFT holders may buy and sell them.

NFT collection creators can earn creator royalties on trades on PancakeSwap, as well as getting visibility for their project on the most prominent NFT marketplace on Binance Smart Chain.

We're now accepting applications for Phase 2 of the Marketplace, which will be released in Q4 2021.
