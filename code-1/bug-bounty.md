# Bug Bounty

The PancakeSwap bug bounty program is focused around our smart contracts, websites, and apps with a primary interest in the prevention of loss of user funds, either by direct draining of locked funds or social engineering attacks by redirecting users or forcing them to sign a transaction.

\*All bug reports must include a Proof of Concept demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited to be eligible for a reward. This may be a smart contract itself or a transaction.

\*XSS reports are restricted to those that have an impact of prompting a user to sign a transaction or a redirect.

All payouts are done by the **PancakeSwap** team and are pegged to the **USD** values set here and are payable in **CAKE** or **BUSD**.
