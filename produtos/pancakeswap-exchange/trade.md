When you make a token swap (trade) on the exchange you will pay a **0.25% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.17%** - Returned to Liquidity Pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.03%** - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury.

**0.05%** - Sent towards CAKE buyback and burn.
