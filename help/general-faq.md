This FAQ page answers some of the more commonly asked questions from the PancakeSwap community.

## How can I stake CAKE? <a href="#how-can-i-stake-cake" id="how-can-i-stake-cake"></a>

You can stake your CAKE in PancakeSwap Syrup Pools. Visit the [Syrup Pools page](https://pancakeswap.finance/pools).

Read our [How to Stake in Syrup Pools guide](../products-1/syrup-pool/how-to-stake-in-syrup-pools.md) if you'd like a hand getting started with staking.

## What is the difference between staking and farming? <a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-staking-and-farming" id="what-is-the-difference-between-staking-and-farming"></a>

Staking in Syrup Pools and farming with Yield Farming are both ways to earn more CAKE by supporting PancakeSwap.

Staking only needs some CAKE to be added to a Syrup Pool to earn CAKE or other tokens. [Learn more about Syrup Pool staking.](../products-1/syrup-pools.md)​

Farming is more complicated and needs LP Tokens to earn CAKE. [Learn more about Yield Farming.](../products-1/yield-farming/)​

## How do I farm? <a href="#how-do-i-farm" id="how-do-i-farm"></a>

## When will you open more pools? <a href="#when-will-you-open-more-pools" id="when-will-you-open-more-pools"></a>

New Pools are added to PancakeSwap frequently. There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

## How do I get airdrops? <a href="#how-do-i-get-airdrops" id="how-do-i-get-airdrops"></a>

Whenever there is an official airdrop on PancakeSwap it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to PancakeSwap users since every transaction is public on BscScan. Be sure to do your own research when it comes to non-official airdrops. To protect your funds, we recommend you don't use a smart contract you don't understand from a source you don't trust.

If you've already [transferred BNB into your Binance Smart Chain-enabled wallet](../get-started-1/get-bep20-tokens.md) but still have this error, you're most likely not [connected to Binance Smart Chain](../get-started-1/connect-your-wallet-to-pancakeswap.md) within your wallet. Check your wallet's selected network and make sure you have Binance Smart Chain (BSC) selected.

## Is PancakeSwap protected from flashloan attacks? <a href="#is-pancakeswap-protected-from-flashloan-attacks" id="is-pancakeswap-protected-from-flashloan-attacks"></a>

PancakeSwap's vault has anti-flashloan protection. PancakeSwap’s CAKE token isn’t vulnerable to flash loan attacks. Unlike vulnerable tokens, CAKE token minting is predefined, and can’t be adjusted in a single transaction. Ownership cannot be transferred outside of MasterChef contract.

PancakeSwap’s other smart contracts, like IFO and AutoPool, are protected as well; they prevent other contracts from interacting with them, reducing the scope of vector attacks.

## Can I join the PancakeSwap team? <a href="#can-i-join-the-pancakeswap-team" id="can-i-join-the-pancakeswap-team"></a>

## What is SYRUP? <a href="#what-is-syrup" id="what-is-syrup"></a>

SYRUP was a part of the staking process earlier in PancakeSwap's life. SYRUP was discontinued when a security issue was discovered and is no longer a part of PancakeSwap.
