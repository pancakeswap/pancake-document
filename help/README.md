If you find yourself stuck, if something isn't working like it's meant to, or you're not sure if something has worked or not, this help section may be able to, well, help.

## Help sections

We have broken the help topic down into sections to help you find what you're after. Below is an overview on what you'll find.

### Troubleshooting Errors

The [Troubleshooting Errors page](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/help/troubleshooting) has a collection of errors users may run into while using PancakeSwap. It shows the problem with both a solution to the problem, and a reason explaining why the problem happened.

### General FAQ

The [General FAQ page](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/help/faq) answers the common questions we get from PancakeSwap users. The answers to these questions give advice, an explanation, or a link to a useful resource.

### Other Guides

There are also a number of guides in the help topic that will walk you through technical problems. We add guides when a problem that may be difficult to solve comes up often, so if you're having trouble be sure to check here for a guide to your problem.

## Seeking support

PancakeSwap doesn't have a dedicated support service. Instead, if you find yourself with a problem that has no answer here, you can ask for help on [PancakeSwap's Telegram channel](https://t.me/pancakeswap). For your safety, make sure you read the notice about scams if it's your first time on our Telegram.
