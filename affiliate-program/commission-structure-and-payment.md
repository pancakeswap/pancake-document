\*\* Trading fees on perpetual trades (or any Referral’s position which may incur liquidation fees) do not include any liquidation fees for liquidating your Referrals’ position. Limited to perpetual trades on **BNB Smart Chain and Ethereum chain only**.

### Payment

Payment will be made paid out to affiliates whose users have accumulated qualified transactions based on the above structure.&#x20;

After each on-chain transaction, we'll calculate your commissions in USD and convert them to CAKE tokens. We do this by determining the USD value of trades and then converting your commission into CAKE tokens based on the current CAKE token price when paying out. More details can be found on the [**Terms & Conditions**](terms-and-conditions.md) page.&#x20;

You can keep an eye on your earnings from the Dashboards page (coming soon!) You’ll also be able to redeem your commissions once every month on the same page. A guide will be posted here on the redemption process.
