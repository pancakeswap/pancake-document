Participating in governance voting is easy, and it is absolutely **FREE**. You don't even need to pay gas fees! Learn more about how to vote, catch the next proposal and cast your vote.

### How to vote

#### Navigate to the vote proposal

Whenever we publish a new proposal, we always attach the link to the voting page. So be sure to follow [our social channels](../../../contact-us/telegram.md) for the news and updates.

Alternatively, you can visit [PancakeSwap's native voting portal](https://voting.pancakeswap.finance/?\_gl=1\*pc8o0h\*\_ga\*MTUzNDEzNDQxMy4xNjAwNzkzNDM4\*\_ga\_334KNG3DMQ\*MTYwNDMwMTk4Ni42MC4xLjE2MDQzMDM3MDIuMA..#/)[ ](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting)to browse the proposals in a list. If you don't see the proposal, it may be in the "soon" tab.

#### Read and pick the choice to vote

In this window, you can double-check the following items:

If you are not sure about how the voting power is calculated, click on the ">" to bring up the detailed breakdown.

Please note that only CAKE held in the following places will contribute to the total number of voting power:

1. In wallet
2. Flexible CAKE Staking (both in CAKE pool and side pool)
3. Fixed Term CAKE Staking (boosted by [vCAKE](../vcake.md)!)
4. Other Syrup Pools (provided by other projects)
5. CAKE/BNB LP&#x20;

CAKE held in other places does not contribute to your voting power.

#### Check the snapshot block

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/how-to-vote-3.png)

Voting power is calculated based on a snapshot taken on the snapshot block. Therefore, purchasing or depositing more CAKE after the proposal is posted is not going to increase the voting power for that particular proposal.

If you want to know the exact time of the snapshot block. Simple click on the block number and look for the timestamp on the BscScan page.
