# Lottery

**Specifics:**

* Lottery Ticket Fee for 1 ticket: 1 CAKE 
* Single User Lottery Entry Limit: No limit
* Paying for one ticket \(1 CAKE\) will give users a random 4 digit combination with each digit being between 1-10, for e.g. “1-9-3-2”
* In the UI, users can choose to enter a multiple of 10 CAKE, which will buy them multiple tickets.

**How to win:**

To win the lottery jackpot \(60% of the entire lottery pool\), users need to match all 4 numbers on their tickets in the same position as the 4 winning numbers.

If you don’t match all 4, no need to worry. As long as you match 2 or more numbers in the correct position, you are guaranteed to win a reward.  


**Winning Ratio:**

* Match all 4 numbers in the exact order = win 60% of the pot \(or split the pot if more than 1 winner\). 
* Match 3 numbers in the exact order = win or split 20% of the pot.
* Match 2 numbers in the exact order = win or split 10% of the pot.
* Burn remaining 10% of the pot.

For example, if the final 4 winning numbers are “1-9-3-2”:  


        - “1-9-3-2” = match all 4

        - “1-9-2-2” = match 3

        - “2-3-3-2” = match 2

        - “1-2-1-2” = match 2  




**Lottery phases:**  


Each full lottery session is completed every 2 hours. An example of a lottery session starting at 0 AM is below:  


**Phase 1 - Buy Tickets \(0 AM to 1:30 AM\)**

* You have 1 hour to buy tickets.

**Phase 2 - Lottery Draw! \(1:30 AM\)**

**How are ticket numbers drawn?**  


The lottery aims to be completely random. Even though the ticket numbers given out are determined by a front-end logic, there is an extremely low chance that anyone is able to determine the 4 winning numbers ahead of time.  


* The 1st lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the number of participating users at the entry deadline.
* The 2nd lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the total pooled cake balance at the entry deadline.
* The 3rd lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the timestamp of the last lottery participant at the entry deadline.
* The 4th lottery number will be determined based on the %10 remainder of a hash encoded by the blockhash and the block difficulty at the entry deadline.
