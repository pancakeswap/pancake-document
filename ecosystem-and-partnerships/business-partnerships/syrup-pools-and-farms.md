3. Marketing Prep
   * We ask for some design assets, some project info, and create a lovely banner (RDNT example below) and a [vote proposal](https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0xffda6f8b092472c5ff034e97624cf473f6c17611857ff250d6a5a910351be535) (only for BNB Chain)
   * Please note that prior to launch, PancakeSwap or Project Teams should not communicate the news of the collaboration.
4. Launch
   * We launch the Syrup Pool/Farm (once the vote proposal passes), and through our team of community admins, we will monitor, collate, and communicate any feedback raised by the community.&#x20;
   * We will also publish some socials on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pancakeswap/status/1640999407414853633?s=21\&t=ASnECSndJTVi6TaLxAOKHg) and [Telegram](https://t.me/PancakeSwap)
