### The people's choice for all things DeFi

Simple is sexy, and so is safety!&#x20;

With more than $1.5B in TVL, we like to move quickly and do so responsibly. Having more than three years of experience in the crypto markets, from bull to bear, we have been effectively delivering DeFi to our community. Don’t just trust us, please verify (link to audits [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/audits)).&#x20;

Our partnerships with projects go beyond just liquidity mining programs (“Syrup Pools and Farms”) and token launch opportunities (“Initial Farm Offerings”). We genuinely recognize the impact of community in crypto – our dedicated team of Ambassadors help us keep a pulse on the diverse communities we serve, and we regularly host events with high engagement with partners: AMAs, meme contests, and many more!

We’re keen to work with you. Let’s make DeFi great again.
