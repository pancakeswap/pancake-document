# Roadmap

![](<.gitbook/assets/docs masthead (19) (1).png>)

Updated Oct. 13, 2021



### This is not a roadmap: It’s a to-do list.

Crypto moves fast, and we move fast too.&#x20;

Pivoting is a way of life.&#x20;

That means that we don’t publicly commit to specific timelines, so we can organize our development priorities based on market changes and developer resources.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Items in the Backlog/exploration phase have not been forgotten, they’re just lower priority in the immediate future than those in the other phases.&#x20;
