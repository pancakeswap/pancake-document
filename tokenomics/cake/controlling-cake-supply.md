# Controlling CAKE supply

## Does CAKE have a hard cap?

Yes, CAKE now has a hard cap of 750M as outlined in our litepaper [https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/](https://v2litepaper.pancakeswap.finance/)

## How CAKE supply is reduced

The chefs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into PancakeSwap's products. The goal is for more CAKE to leave circulation than the amount of CAKE that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of CAKE made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: Since the [first reduction in block emissions](https://voting.pancakeswap.finance/#/pancake/proposal/QmWSQZsqakCMQ1bmcoEsKzStdtdFHL6cohSjnMV9ira1EC), we've already effectively reduced the number of CAKE entering circulation from 40 CAKE per block to 13.75. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

Regular token burns ([view burn address](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)) are built into many of PancakeSwap's products (like a 10% burn of CAKE spent on lottery tickets), with more on the way. Check the [**CAKE Tokenomics page**](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics) for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
