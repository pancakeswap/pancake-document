## The basics

CAKE is the delicious token that powers the PancakeSwap ecosystem.

Earn CAKE from Farms and Syrup Pools, win it in the lottery, or [buy it on the exchange](../../products/pancakeswap-exchange/), then explore its use cases:

* Stake it in [Syrup Pools](../../products/syrup-pool/) to earn free tokens
* Use it in [Yield Farms](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/yield-farming) to earn more CAKE
* Buy Lottery tickets in the [PancakeSwap Lottery](../../products/lottery/)
* Participate in [IFO Token Sales](../../products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/)
* Create your [Pancake Profile](../../products/nft-profile-system/) and mint NFTs
* [Vote on proposals](../../products/voting/) relating to the PancakeSwap ecosystem

But that's not all -- there's much more on the horizon for CAKE!
