* ‚úÖ **Download and install only the latest version from an official source.**
* ‚úÖ **Follow the setup guide carefully.**
* ‚úÖ **Safely back up your recovery phrases.**
* ‚ùå **NEVER share your recovery phrases with anyone, under any circumstances.**
* ‚ùå **NEVER input your recovery phrase to a website or app, other than your wallet app.**
