# Migrate Your Stakings

![ICYDK: you are currently reading the "tutorial" mentioned in this banner](../../.gitbook/assets/migration-preheat.png)

In order to keep earning staking rewards, you will need to migrate your farms and pools staking to the new MasterChef. Relax, it's gonna be easy.

{% hint style="info" %}
**But wait! Do I need to migrate?**

You need to migrate if you are:

* Farming on PancakeSwap **Farms**.
* Staking in PancakeSwap **CAKE Syrup Pools** (Manual, Auto, IFO).

\*other Syrup Pools aren’t affected
{% endhint %}

## How to migrate?

![At the time of the migration, Chefs will deploy a step-by-step helper to walk you through the process ](../../.gitbook/assets/migration-helper-overview.png)

### 1. Look for the migration helper

Click "**Proceed**" to visit the migration helper.

### 2. Unstake from the old farms

There are two steps in the migration helper. In the first step, you should see a list of three CAKE syrup pools and farms you are currently staking.

Click "**Unstake All**" on each of the farms and pools to unstake all your assets.

After unstaking, click "**Go to Stake**" to proceed to step 2.

### 3. Stake your LP tokens and CAKE into the new farms and pools.

Here you should see the brand new CAKE syrup pool and the new farms. Before staking, you will need to enable them.

Click "**Enable**" to enable staking on each of the farms and the CAKE syrup pool. If you are using a mobile device, please click the “**v**” (downward arrow) to expand the card while looking for the "**Enable**" button.

After enabling, you will be able to start staking in the pool and farms.
